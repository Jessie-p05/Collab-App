# CollabApp

CollabApp aims for finding collaborators for online projects. 

Similar to dating apps that match based on preferences, it matches groups of people who are interested in working on the same kind of project. 

This app is tailored to people who want to work on side projects but don't have the networking skills to find collaborators.

Create your profile with your skills by registration, and then autoMatch for a group based on those skills. You will be shown a selection of projects that match your settings.
You can talk to the group members and get more information about this project, send a join request if everything goes well. After joining a group, you can set goals for the project, or send mentor requests when you get stuck.


Target Audience: People who have great ideas for a project, but need collaborators with specific skills. People who want to join a project, but donâ€™t have any ideas. Any professionals or amateur project makers Web designers, Software designers, YouTubers, artists, writers, game designers Mentors.

### Tech stack
React, Express, Sequelize, Socket.io


## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into root folder. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then run `npm run db:reset` or `yarn run db:reset`to set the database, finally `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to launch the server.

In the browser, you can see the data get loaded.
